## How to force Turn Off Computer?

If your computer does not shut down using the shut down options in the operating system, you may need to force a shut down. Sometimes a program gets stuck and does not stop running, hardware drivers may be causing issues, the operating system has corrupt system files, or the computer is frozen, and nothing works. Each of these cases may require a forced shut down to turn off the computer.

To force a computer to shut down, find the computer's power button. The picture is an example of a power button on a computer. Press and hold the power button until the computer turns off, then release the power button.

## Why Should You Turn Off Computer Every Night?

If you use it for work or several times throughout the day, it’s better to leave it on more frequently than turning it off. The work involved in launching everything needed is taxing on your computer’s hardware. The more it needs to power up, the more work the hardware will need to do, causing additional wear and tear over time.

If you only use it for a short time, say, for up to a couple of hours – once a day – or less, then it would be better off being turned off at night.
